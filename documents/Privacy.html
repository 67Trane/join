        Welcome to the help page for Join, your guide to using our kanban
        project management tool. Here, we'll provide an overview of what Join
        is, how it can benefit you, and how to use it
      </p>
      <h3>What is Join?</h3>
      <p>
        Join is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a
        group of dedicated students as part of their web development bootcamp at
        the Developer Akademie. Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is
        a highly effective method to visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and
        maximize efficiency (or flow). Join leverages the principles of kanban
        to help users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual
        interface. It is important to note that Join is designed as an
        educational exercise and is not intended for extensive business usage.
        While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot
        guarantee consistent availability, reliability, accuracy, or other
        aspects of quality regarding Join.
